## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- SCSS
- SASS engine
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- Font Awesome icons

### What I learned

In this project I have practiced combining previously learned skills in building a more realistic landing page. New thing I have learned is using basics of SCSS language and SASS engine for improving the styling sheets and making them more concise. I have used the SCSS variables and mixins together with nested instructions.

### Continued development

In the previous projects I would like to continue learning SCSS and practice some of the useful practices within HTML and CSS, such as styling buttons, creating clear grid and flex designs. I would also like to get more into JavaScript to add practical usages to my projects.

### Useful resources
